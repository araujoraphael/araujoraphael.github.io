00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:05.033 
JEFF: <i>Just 10 minutes from</i>
<i>Canada's busiest highway sits</i>

00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:09.833 
<i>this serene lake, which holds</i>
<i>the secrets of human history.</i>

00:00:09.833 --> 00:00:11.533 
It's an incredible site.

00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:14.600 
<i>Tim Patterson and his team of</i>
<i>geologists have spent years</i>

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.733 
<i>studying Crawford Lake,</i>

00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:19.866 
<i>created 13,000 years ago</i>
<i>by a collapsed cave.</i>

00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:24.066 
<i>The little lake is incredibly</i>
<i>deep, reaching down 24 m.</i>

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:27.366 
<i>The bottom is so well-protected</i>
<i>that it's become like</i>

00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:31.433 
<i>a time capsule, absorbing</i>
<i>thousands of years of history.</i>

00:00:31.433 --> 00:00:33.033 
(Drill whirring)

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.133 
<i>When the geologists retrieved</i>
<i>samples of sediment</i>

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.800 
<i>from the lake floor,</i>
<i>they found its layers were like</i>

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.066 
<i>the rings of a tree, each line</i>
<i>offering clues to its age.</i>

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.833 
<i>These layers, for example,</i>

00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:47.233 
<i>formed during a terrible</i>
<i>drought in 1935.</i>

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:49.400 
<i>But by around 1950,</i>

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.400 
<i>the chemistry of the lake</i>
<i>began to change...</i>

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.133 
...when essentially there was
enormous economic development

00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.066 
as the world recovered
from World War II.

00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:01.733 
<i>Radioactive plutonium was found</i>
<i>in the mud, thought to be from</i>

00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:04.833 
<i>nuclear weapons tests</i>
<i>thousands of kilometres away.</i>

00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:07.466 
<i>The sediment showed effects</i>
<i>from acid rain and</i>

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:11.800 
<i>fossil fuels, and some microbe</i>
<i>species began to disappear.</i>

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.766 
And now we've changed the
character of the system so much

00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.500 
that we're actually leaving

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.166 
a geological record of
human activity.

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.200 
JEFF: Crawford Lake is unique.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.266 
No other body of water on Earth

00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:26.466 
is known to contain this
combination of attributes,

00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:29.733 
and this little lake has now
caught the world's attention.

00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:31.533 
The Anthropocene thesis...

00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:34.133 
<i>This international panel of</i>
<i>scientists announced</i>

00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:37.200 
<i>Crawford Lake had been chosen</i>
<i>to mark the start of</i>

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.633 
<i>a new chapter</i>
<i>in Earth's history</i>

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:43.300 
<i>known as the Anthropocene,</i>
<i>or the Age of Humans.</i>

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.233 
Human beings as a species
are becoming

00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:47.866 
the greatest force of nature.

00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:50.300 
<i>This renowned Canadian</i>
<i>photographer produced</i>

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.566 
<i>a documentary on</i>
<i>the Anthropocene,</i>

00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:55.600 
<i>the world-altering event that</i>
<i>some scientists consider</i>

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.400 
<i>comparable to the extinction</i>
<i>of the dinosaurs.</i>

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.466 
And today, we're having a slower
motion extinction event,

00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:06.900 
but we are now the equivalent
of a meteor impact.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.566 
<i>Scientists are still debating</i>

00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:11.833 
<i>whether Anthropocene should be</i>
<i>considered an official epoch,</i>

00:02:11.833 --> 00:02:15.300 
<i>and samples from Crawford Lake</i>
<i>will be used as evidence.</i>

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.300 
It is the first step towards
the potential ratification

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.533 
of Anthropocene
as a geological epoch.

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:27.233 
<i>And Crawford Lake</i>
<i>also offers hope.</i>

00:02:27.233 --> 00:02:29.566 
<i>In recent decades,</i>
<i>as the world reduced</i>

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:32.066 
<i>nuclear weapons testing,</i>
<i>acid rain,</i>

00:02:32.066 --> 00:02:35.366 
<i>and coal power production,</i>
<i>something incredible happened.</i>

00:02:35.366 --> 00:02:38.100 
<i>The lake began to heal.</i>

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.633
